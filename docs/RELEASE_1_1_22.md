# Vaultarr 1.1.22 — Active Route Reload Fix

## Fixed

- Clicking the Library category that is already active no longer performs a full browser reload.
- Prevents the raw-HTML flash seen when clicking **All Games** while already viewing **All Games**, and applies the same protection to equivalent active links throughout Vaultarr.
- Keeps the exact 1.1.21 sidebar motion, card UI, card expansion, Focus Mode, and close-flicker fix unchanged.

## Deployment

- The production Compose example now pulls `ghcr.io/linkssy2/vaultarr:latest` instead of using `build: .`.
- README includes Linux, Windows, Dockge, update, and local-development instructions.

## Notes

This is a targeted frontend navigation fix. Backend, database, metadata, preservation, archive, card expansion, and Focus Mode behavior are unchanged.
