# Vaultarr 1.1.21 — Exact Sidebar Motion Restoration

This patch restores the sidebar navigation animation directly from the confirmed 1.1.7 source rather than approximating its appearance.

## Fixed

- Restored the exact 1.1.7 outgoing fade, downward drift, scale, blur, timing, and easing.
- Restored the exact 1.1.7 entrance animation and handoff timing.
- Sidebar motion now begins immediately on click, matching the original interaction flow.
- Retained the newer prepared-page loading, page cache, script restoration, and HTML-flash protection.
- Preserved the 1.1.18 Focus Mode close-flicker repair.
- Card UI, hover behavior, expansion geometry, Focus Mode layout, and backend behavior remain unchanged.
